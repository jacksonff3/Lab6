# Lab6
The purpose of this lab was to take a csv file full of EMPLIDS and grades and allow users to calculate their grade after they've entered the grade of the assignments that haven't been assigned yet

1)I approached this lab by first sorting all the arrays by the students current subtotals from least to greatest that way you could see the students current rankings in class
2)Then I implemented a search function to let the user look up their emplid and to look at the grades of the assignments they've already completed
3)If the user wishes they can calculate the grade they'll get by the end of the semester by entering the the respective grades they believe they'll get on each assignment and the program would return a letter grade to them
